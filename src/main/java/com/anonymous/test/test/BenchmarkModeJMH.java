     * JMH generates lots of synthetic code for the benchmarks for you during
     * the benchmark compilation. JMH can measure the benchmark methods in lots
     * of modes. Users may select the default benchmark mode with a special
     * annotation, or select/override the mode via the runtime options.
     *
     * With this scenario, we start to measure something useful. Note that our
     * payload code potentially throws exceptions, and we can just declare them
     * to be thrown. If the code throws the actual exception, the benchmark
     * execution will stop with an error.
     *
     * When you are puzzled with some particular behavior, it usually helps to
     * look into the generated code. You might see the code is doing not
     * something you intend it to do. Good experiments always follow up on the
     * experimental setup, and cross-checking the generated code is an important
     * part of that follow up.
     *
     * The generated code for this particular sample is somewhere at
     * target/generated-sources/annotations/.../JMHSample_02_BenchmarkModes.java

     * We are using the special annotation to select the units to measure in,

     * ============================== HOW TO RUN THIS TEST: ====================================
     *
     * You are expected to see the different run modes for the same benchmark.
     * Note the units are different, scores are consistent with each other.
     *
     * You can run this test:
     *
     * a) Via the command line:
     *    $ mvn clean install
     *    $ java -jar target/benchmarks.jar JMHSample_02 -f 1
     *    (we requested a single fork; there are also other options, see -h)
     *
     * b) Via the Java API:
     *    (see the JMH homepage for possible caveats when running from IDE:
     *      http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/)
